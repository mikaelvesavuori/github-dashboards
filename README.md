# GitHub Dashboards

## Visualize your GitHub repositories and their workflow statuses ðŸ“ˆ like no thing at all ðŸ˜Ž

This is a ready-to-use solution with a serverless backend (AWS: API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB) and a simple frontend to render the dashboards.

Works with both private and public repositories.

## Solution

Calls are made from the front-end to the back-end without any authorization. It's suggested you lock down the front-end with some applicable means, like an SSO layer or Cloudflare Access or something similar.

_If you want to get data for private repositories you will need a "classic" GitHub personal access token (PAT) with permissions to use the `workflow` scope. If you are in an organization, make sure to authorize the use of the token against your organization._

From the Lambda function, it will first check a hash of the input in DynamoDB as a type of cache. If the cache has content and it's fresher than a minute, return it. Else go to GitHub to retrieve workflow data, transform it a bit, pass it to Shields.io to generate the SVG badge, and then finally return all of it.

_If you're curious, each dashboard component is ~1200 bytes so that should give you an idea for the DynamoDB usage._

**Feel free to upgrade it with nicer visuals, API keys or security, client-side caching, or anything else you fancy!**

## Prerequisites

- Recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (ideally 20+) installed.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with sufficient permissions so that you can deploy infrastructure.
- Ideally some experience with [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com) as that's what we will use to deploy the service and infrastructure.
- You will need to deploy the stack prior to working with it locally as it uses actual infrastructure even in local mode.

## Installation

Clone, fork, or download the repo as you normally would. Run `npm install`.

## Deployment

Run `npm run deploy` once you are authenticated with AWS. You will get a URL for your endpoint - use this in the front-end code.

For the front-end, just host it on a static website host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify.

## Commands

The below commands are the most critical ones. See `package.json` for more commands! Substitute `npm` for `yarn` or whatever floats your boat.

- `npm start`: Run Serverless Framework in offline mode
- `npm test`: Run tests on the codebase
- `npm run deploy`: Deploy with Serverless Framework
- `npm run build`: Package and build the code with Serverless Framework
- `npm run teardown`: Removes the deployed stack

## Configuration

### Required

You have to set the following in `serverless.yml`:

- `custom.config.awsAccountNumber`: Your AWS account number.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` must be set if you want to call private repositories.

_Optionally you can use AWS Secrets Manager instead of hard-coding the GitHub token. There is some code prepped for this, but you will have to manually create the secret in your AWS account._

In `frontend/index.html`, you will have to modify:

- The endpoint for the `getData()` function, as well as the ingoing payload.

## Example API call

### Get dashboard data

#### Request

`POST {{BASE_URL}}/`

```json

  },
  ...
]
```

#### Successful response

Example below. One object per successful request.

```json
[
  {
    "conclusion": "success",
    "status": "completed",
    "owner": "mikaelvesavuori",
    "repo": "dorametrix",
    "ref": "main",
